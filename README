Sneak is a Vim plugin that enables you to move to any location specified by two characters. It works across multiple lines; with operators (including repeat .); and in visual mode. Move to the next or previous match via ; or ,. Move to the nth match by prefixing ; or , with a [count].

The plugin chooses sane defaults, which are easily changed via <Plug> mappings. See :help sneak for options and details.
